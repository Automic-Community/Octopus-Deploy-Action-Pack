<p>Octopus Deploy is a tool to deploy .NET applications to Windows servers.</p>
<p>The Octopus Deploy Action Pack allows you to orchestrate Octopus Deploy in order to deploy .NET applications as part of your automated Application Release workflows. This could be a provisional step before migrating to native deployment and management capabilities within Automic Release Automation.</p>

<p>The action pack uses the Octopus Deploy CLI which can be downloaded from the Octopus web site.</p>
